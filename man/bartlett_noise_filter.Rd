\usage{
bartlett_noise_filter(x,y)

\arguments{
\item{x}{RasterBrick or TimeSeries}

\value{
RasterBrick or TimeSeries of Yearly data

\description{
A triangular Filter for smoothing data

The filter will take a weighted average of a specified number of points around the point of interest to create a smoother time series. For example, if the size of the filter is set to 31, the filter will take the 15 points before and after the point of interest (for a total of 31 points), and calculate a weighted average based on how far away the points are from the point of interest.
