Title: Mid Summer Drought Values
Version: 0.1.6

Description: This package calculates some important values of the mid summer drought using four functions: onset, minimum,
    duration, and intensity. These functions all take in a time series of daily values, apply a triangular smoothing function
    to the data, and then calculate the respective value. This package can be used with a time series vector or a rasterbrick.
    Some important notes are that this package currently only supports 365 day years, and assumes that the time series starts
    with Janurary 1st and not any other value.
